# Feature Breakdown

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. User Identity Mapping

**Description**: Map Slack users to Linear users via email addresses to enable personalized reports.

**User Stories**:
- As a system admin, I want the system to automatically sync Slack and Linear user identities so reports are sent to the correct people
- As a developer, I want my Slack account to be automatically linked to my Linear account without manual configuration

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] System fetches all Slack workspace users daily
- [ ] System stores email ‚Üí Slack User ID ‚Üí Linear User ID mappings
- [ ] Email is used as the common identifier between systems
- [ ] Inactive/deleted users are marked and excluded from reports
- [ ] Manual sync endpoint available for immediate updates

**Technical Requirements**:
- Database table: `users` with columns for email, slack_user_id, linear_user_id
- Slack API call: `users.list` with `users:read.email` scope
- Linear API call: `viewer` query to get current user email
- Daily cron job for automated syncing
- Handle users without matching emails gracefully

**Edge Cases**:
- User exists in Slack but not Linear (skip)
- User exists in Linear but not Slack (skip)
- Multiple users with same email (log warning, use first match)
- User changes email (re-sync on next job)
- User deactivated in one system but not the other (mark inactive)

---

### 2. Linear Data Fetching

**Description**: Query Linear's GraphQL API to fetch ALL of a user's assigned issues (open + recently closed) and project information.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to see ALL issues currently assigned to me, not just recently touched ones
- As a developer, I want to see which issues I completed, started, or updated in the last week
- As a developer, I want issues grouped by project for better organization
- As a developer, I want visibility into all open work, even if it hasn't been touched recently

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Fetch ALL open issues assigned to the user (regardless of last update)
- [ ] Include recently closed issues (closed within past month) for historical context
- [ ] Optimize: Exclude issues that are BOTH closed AND not updated in past month
- [ ] Include issue metadata: identifier, title, state, priority, estimate
- [ ] Include related entities: project, team
- [ ] Handle pagination for users with many issues
- [ ] Categorize issues by recent activity (what happened in last 7 days)
- [ ] Respect Linear API rate limits (1,500 req/hr)

**Technical Requirements**:
- GraphQL query using `viewer.assignedIssues` with optimized filter
- Filter: `OR(state NOT IN [completed, canceled], updatedAt >= 1 month ago)`
- Fields: id, identifier, title, state{name, type}, project{name}, priority, estimate, createdAt, updatedAt, completedAt, startedAt, canceledAt
- Implement cursor-based pagination
- Client-side categorization by date ranges
- Error handling for API failures

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface UserReport {
  user: {
    id: string
    name: string
    email: string
  }
  periodStart: Date  // Used for categorization only
  periodEnd: Date

  // Categorized by recent activity (last 7 days)
  recentlyCompleted: LinearIssue[]
  recentlyStarted: LinearIssue[]
  recentlyUpdated: LinearIssue[]

  // All other open issues (not recently touched but still assigned)
  otherOpenIssues: LinearIssue[]

  // Grouped summary
  projectSummary: {
    projectName: string | null  // null for issues not on a project
    issueCount: number
    openCount: number
    completedCount: number
  }[]
}
```

**API Optimization Strategy**:
- Fetch all assigned issues with filter: `OR(open, updated_in_last_month)`
- This excludes only old closed issues, keeping all active work visible
- Typical savings: 50-80% reduction in payload for developers with long histories

---

### 3. Cooldown Period Tracking

**Description**: Allow developers to configure cooldown periods when they focus on non-feature work, adjusting report content accordingly.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to set my next cooldown start date and duration so the system knows when I'm in cooldown
- As a developer in cooldown, I want reports to acknowledge my cooldown status and adjust expectations
- As a developer, I want to update or cancel my cooldown schedule if plans change

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Store cooldown schedules: next start date + duration in weeks
- [ ] Calculate if user is currently in cooldown based on today's date
- [ ] Provide API endpoint to set/update/delete cooldown schedules
- [ ] Include cooldown status in weekly reports
- [ ] Automatically calculate next cooldown end date
- [ ] Support multiple recurring cooldown periods (future enhancement)

**Technical Requirements**:
- Database table: `cooldown_schedules`
- Fields: user_id, next_cooldown_start (DATE), cooldown_duration_weeks (INT)
- API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/cooldown/set { userId, nextStart, durationWeeks }`
  - `GET /api/cooldown/:userId`
  - `PUT /api/cooldown/:userId`
  - `DELETE /api/cooldown/:userId`
- Service method: `isUserInCooldown(userId: string, date: Date): boolean`

**Calculation Logic**:
```
User is in cooldown if:
  today >= next_cooldown_start AND
  today < (next_cooldown_start + cooldown_duration_weeks)
```

**Report Adjustments During Cooldown**:
- Add banner: "üå¥ You're in cooldown mode (Week 1 of 2)"
- **Filter issues to cooldown-appropriate work**:
  - Show issues NOT part of a project board
  - Exception: Include issues from projects with "misc" or "DPE" in the name (case-insensitive)
  - Rationale: Cooldown focuses on maintenance, tech debt, miscellaneous work - not feature boards
- Emphasize cooldown-appropriate work (refactoring, docs, tech debt, misc tasks)
- De-emphasize feature velocity metrics
- Show cooldown end date

**Cooldown Filtering Logic**:
```typescript
function filterForCooldown(issues: LinearIssue[]): LinearIssue[] {
  return issues.filter(issue => {
    // Include if no project (unboarded work)
    if (!issue.project) return true

    // Include if project name contains 'misc' or 'dpe' (case-insensitive)
    const projectName = issue.project.name.toLowerCase()
    if (projectName.includes('misc') || projectName.includes('dpe')) {
      return true
    }

    // Exclude all other project board issues
    return false
  })
}
```

### 4. Weekly Report Generation

**Description**: Generate personalized weekly status reports showing ALL assigned issues with recent activity highlighted, adjusted for cooldown context.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to receive a summary of my week's work every Monday morning
- As a developer, I want to see ALL my open issues, not just recently touched ones
- As a developer, I want recent activity (completed, started, updated) clearly highlighted
- As a developer, I want visibility into stale issues that need attention
- As a developer in cooldown, I want the report to show only cooldown-appropriate work

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Generate reports for all active users
- [ ] Show ALL open issues assigned to the user
- [ ] Categorize by recent activity: Completed (last 7 days), Started (last 7 days), Updated (last 7 days)
- [ ] Show other open issues not recently touched (potential blockers or forgotten work)
- [ ] Apply cooldown filtering if user is in cooldown (no project board issues except misc/DPE)
- [ ] Group issues by project for organization
- [ ] Show issue counts and key metrics
- [ ] Include cooldown status if applicable
- [ ] Format report in clear, scannable structure
- [ ] Handle users with no issues (send minimal summary)

**Technical Requirements**:
- Service: `ReportGenerationService`
- Input: Linear data, cooldown status
- Output: Structured report object
- Formatting: Plain text with optional Slack Block Kit (Phase 2)

**Report Structure**:
```
