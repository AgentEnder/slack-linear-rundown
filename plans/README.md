2. Reference: `01-api-research.md` for external API details
3. Cross-reference: `03-features.md` for requirements

### For Understanding Requirements
1. Read: `03-features.md` - MVP features (sections 1-7)
2. Review: `03-features.md` - Future features (sections 8-15)
3. Check: `04-implementation-roadmap.md` - Success criteria

### For Project Management
1. Use: `04-implementation-roadmap.md` - Timeline and phases
2. Track: Task completion against roadmap phases
3. Monitor: Success criteria and risk mitigation strategies

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Monorepo**: Nx for managing libraries and applications
- **Database**: SQLite for MVP (simple, file-based, sufficient for <100 users)
- **Scheduling**: node-cron (in-process, simple, reliable)
- **API Framework**: Express.js (mature, well-supported)
- **Language**: TypeScript (type safety, better DX)

### Design Decisions
- **User Mapping**: Email as common key between Slack and Linear
- **Report Timing**: Monday 9 AM default (configurable)
- **Report Format**: Plain text for MVP, Slack Block Kit in Phase 2
- **Cooldown Tracking**: Manual setting via API (future: Slack commands)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, log and continue

### Scope Decisions
- **MVP Scope**: 7 core features (user mapping, data fetching, cooldowns, reports, delivery, scheduling, health check)
- **Phase 2**: Interactive commands, rich formatting (P1 priority)
- **Deferred**: Team reports, analytics dashboard, multi-workspace (P2-P3)

## Development Principles

From `CLAUDE.md` and applied throughout planning:

1. **Research → Plan → Implement**: We completed research and planning before any code
2. **Simplicity**: Choose simple, obvious solutions over clever ones
3. **No Backwards Compatibility**: This is a greenfield project, optimize for clarity
4. **Early Returns**: Prefer early returns over deep nesting
5. **Concrete Types**: No `any` or `interface{}` types
6. **Delete Old Code**: When replacing code, delete the old version completely

## Next Steps

After reviewing the plans:

1. **Get Approval**: Review plans with stakeholders
2. **Gather Credentials**: Set up Slack app and get Linear API key
3. **Start Phase 0**: Follow `04-implementation-roadmap.md` starting with task 0.1
4. **Track Progress**: Use roadmap tasks as checklist
5. **Document Changes**: Update plans if requirements change
