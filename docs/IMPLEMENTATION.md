## Known Limitations

### Current Scope (MVP)
1. **Plain Text Reports** - Slack Block Kit formatting is Phase 2
2. **No Interactive Commands** - Slash commands are Phase 2
3. **SQLite Database** - Single instance only (sufficient for <100 users)
4. **No Team Reports** - Individual reports only (team reports Phase 2)
5. **No Analytics Dashboard** - Phase 3 feature

### Minor Issues
1. **Import.meta warning** in database library - Benign, ESM vs CJS compatibility issue
2. **No integration tests** for API endpoints - Unit tests only for MVP
3. **Mock clients in jobs** - Jobs need SlackClient/LinearClient to run tests

---
